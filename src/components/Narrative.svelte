<p>Here's the story. W.E.B. Du Bois was some man for one man.</p>
<p>Before you make a fool of yourself like I did, his name is pronounced <span style="font-style: bold;">dew-BOYSS</span> and not <span style="font-style: bold;">duh-BWAH</span> so look out for that one, if it happened to me it could happen to you.</p>
<p>The United States is a hella racist place these days so you can bet your bottom dollar Du Bois grew up with surrounded by some deep rooted old-time racism, being born in 1868 just a five years after the Proclamation of Emancipation.</p>
<p>Du Bois had no time for this racism or any of it's trappings be it lynchings, Jim Crow laws, or discrimination </p>
