    William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868â€“1963) was an American sociologist, 
    socialist, historian, and Pan-Africanist civil rights activist. 
    In 1895 he became the first African-American to be awarded a PhD, and four years 
    later he co-founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

<p>The United States is a hella racist place these days so you can bet your bottom dollar Du Bois grew up with surrounded by some deep rooted old-time racism, being born in 1868 just a five years after the Proclamation of Emancipation.</p>
<p>Du Bois had no time for this racism or any of it's trappings be it lynchings, Jim Crow laws, or discrimination </p>
