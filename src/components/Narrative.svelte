    William Edward Burghardt Du Bois (1868â€“1963) was an American sociologist, 
    socialist, historian, and Pan-Africanist civil rights activist. 
    In 1895, he became the first African-American to be awarded a PhD and four years 
    later he co-founded the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP).

    Du Bois was a powerful advocate for African American rights, and 
    in his books and writings he railed
    against the prevailing racism and discrimination that Black people 
    experienced under the Jim Crow laws.

    Du Bois organised an exhibit for the 1900 Paris Exposition 
    aiming to showcase the history and conditions of Black people 
    in America. The exhibit comprised hundreds of charts, photographs
    and maps which illustrated the striking progress achieved by African
    Americans since emancipation in areas such as education, home ownership
    and literacy.

    The optimism and confidence of the age, and the potential for the 
    Exhibit to confront racist tropes with the achievements of black 
    people is reflected in the powerful 
    passage below, taken from a review of the Exhibit 
    published in the African American-led newspaper 
    <span style="font-style: italic;">The Colored American</span>.
