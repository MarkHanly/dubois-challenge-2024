The American Negro may not have established an independent government and
he may be lacking in all the paraphernalia of royalty but his progress has
been no less marked in civilization and any just consideration of its 
marvelous progress falls far short of the truth if it puts him down as a zero
unless that zero multiplies by ten.

At the opening of this century the Constitution of the United States was
still in swaddling clothes the slave trade was in all its vigor and horrors
of the middle passage and in practically every State in the Union the
crack of the slave whip might have been heard The great American Constitution, 
which has been characterized by William Lloyd Garrison as "A Covenant with death 
and an agreement with hell" had sanctioned forever the ownership of human property and thus
to deny the truth of its own statement that "men are created equal." Let us
not refer to the terrible blasphemy in which slave sympathizing preachers
proved by Apostle Paul's epistles the holiness of slavery nor to the great
chivalry of the South which made concubines of our illiterate, helpless mothers.
This will be too much, and the picture is complete without it. Suffice
it to say that the century closes in beautiful contrast and from the four
comers of the Nation Negroes have sent here to the Universal Exposition
proofs of progress in manhood, womanhood education industry and all the evidences 
of good citizenship.
